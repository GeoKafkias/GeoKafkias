### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working on my PhD and freelancing for a new startup. My research focuses on Customer Analysis Behaviour using computational approaches to tackle challenging problems in the decision-making field. I specialise in exploiting unstructured information with NLP techniques and am always looking for ways to improve and stay up-to-date on the latest trends and best practices.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning and improving my skills in web API development. 
- 🏀 When I'm not working, you can find me playing basketball with my friends or relaxing in my hometown in Greece 🏖️. 
- 📮 Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn 👀 to learn more about my work or to chat about potential collaboration opportunities. I'm always open to new ideas and love the chance to work with others who share my passion for new technologies in the AI field.
